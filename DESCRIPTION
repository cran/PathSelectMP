Description: Primarily for use with datasets containing only categorical variables, although continuous variables may be included as independent variables in paths. Using M Plus, backward variable selection is performed on all Total, Total Indirect, and then Direct effects until none of these effects have p-values greater than the specified target p-value. If there are missing values in the data, imputations are performed using the Mice package. Then selection is performed with the imputed data sets, and results are averaged.
